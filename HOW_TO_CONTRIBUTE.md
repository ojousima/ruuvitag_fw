## Setting up development environment
To develop for RuuviTags you essentially need only your computer, a device with Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) support 
and a single Ruuvitag. 

On a modern computer you can try out our development virtual machine image [here](http://46.101.140.152/RuuviBuilder_public_01.ova).
user name is "ruuvi-user", and password is "ruuvi-user".
If you want to setup your environment, you need :

- git
- [ARMGCC](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded) compiler
- [nrfutil](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/pc-nrfutil) program for generating DFU packets to upload to tag. 

You might additionally benefit from [JLink](https://www.segger.com/jlink-debug-probes.html) used to 
connect to tags with SWD, GDB debugger etc. more advanced tools.

##Getting in touch with community
You can always request invite to Ruuvi's Slack channel by emailing us an informal request at [slack@ruuvi.com](mailto:slack@ruuvi.com). 

A more structured way to see what people are working on is to take a look at [Ruuvi's Trello board](https://trello.com/b/kz1llpvK/ruuvitag-firmware). 

Please check if any work is being done on the task you're interested and either join in or announce (for example by commenting on appropriate Trello card) that you've started to work in the area.

## Contributing code to RuuviTag
Contributing is done by forking Ruuvi's main repository and making a branch which contains your work.
Once you're happy with your branch, please submit a pull request to Ruuvi's master branch through GitHub's web interface. 

We do not have any strict coding guidelines or conventions which would have to be followed to letter. 
However please make sure any pull request you make follows the directory structure shown in README, and ask
for advice if you're unsure to where your code should go. 

Once you're made a pull request, Ruuvi Team will run automated Jenkins check to see that the main makefile
compliles. Please be sure that the main makefile compiles the code you've made. If the Jenkins tests
pass, your work is manually reviewed and tested. 

Once we've reviewed your code, it will be merged into Ruuvi's main branch. Once we're merged your code,
we'll do our best to maintain the compatibility in future work of Ruuvi's software, so you do not have to worry some library change obsoleting your application.

## Contributing other services, examples, integrations
Aside from code that runs in RuuviTag, there's a lot of applications which use something that RuuviTag produces, for example weather logging services, tracking services etc. Contact us through email at [info@ruuvi.com](mailto:info@ruuvi.com) or through slack and we'll se how we can support your work.
